    <h1>Look at the bright side</h1>
<p>Suddenly, the moon vanished.</p>
<p>Marc had started to plan his evening several weeks ago, and so far it had been an impeccable success. Nocturne birds watching was in his opinion the king of entertainment, the culmination of five millennia of human culture and the most pleasurable activity one could practice in the intimacy of the night. However, he had to admit that this incomparable delight came at a heavy cost: sleep deprivation, back pain from sustained uncomfortable positions, and worst of all, the contempt welcoming the description of that noble art to his less educated peers. Furthermore, it demanded meticulous preparation well ahead of time, for the privilege of photographing a <em>Lamus Hobbia</em> blinking is not granted to the faint of heart, nor the slow of mind.</p>
<p>First, the thorough ornithologist had to carefully choose its field of operation; ideally a park rich in trees and poor in people. Nothing deter birds like some junkie students returning from their weekly orgies and yelling drunkard songs at each other. The police station near the small forest he had picked guaranteed that such troublesome folks would stay away. Then, Marc had to gather various piece of gears and consumable: a pricey camera overhauled by various lenses, liters of coffee to keep him alert, nutritious biscuits to avoid starvation, and a few pineapples, for — is it even needed to write it once more? — no other fruit could compete with its sweet and exotic taste. Ingesting such large quantities of food and beverage required expelling them silently and motionlessly, which was not simple feat. Fortunately, this could be achieved thanks to an ingenious device, which decency forbids to describe in more details yet is manufactured with great craft in German factories and found abundantly on specialised websites. Finally, he had to wait for a not so common combination of good weather, clear sky, and above all, a moon as full as possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, its disappearance was outrageous. Not to mention weird. And disturbing. And plain impossible! Marc rushed to the nearby police station as fast as the sudden darkness permitted and barged in the first occupied office:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman sitting at his desk slowly raised his head from the small pieces of wood he was manipulating, put his glasses back on his nose and lighted his face with a reassuring smile :</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there… slow down cow-boy. First take a seat, a deep breath and a sip of water if you’d like. Then tell me your name, occupation and place of residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on Earth would I do that? Didn’t you hear what I just…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, us humans are creatures of habits and there is something soothing in abiding by those customs and social conventions such as introducing ourself. How comfortable to live in a predictable environment and not in a wild jungle. Plus, if I took on this job, it’s because I’m a tireless explorer of the human nature and I would like to know more about you. But the short answer is that it’s the standard procedure and I can’t register your statement otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His monotone voice and relaxed gestures indeed calmed Marc, which answered with a similar intonation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m Marc Tesson, I work as an accountant and I live at 22th, St. James street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. James street, really? Does Ms. Patrick still own that vegetable cutlery shop at the corner with Barley street? If I was to confess to you how much money I have spent there, you would look at me in awe. I am Robert McCallan and I’m delighted to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands with asymmetric enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we aren’t great apes shouting at each other anymore but rather civilized individuals holding a policed and rational conversation, you should tell me what dismay brings you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon has disappeared! It was up in the sky as usual and the next moment, nothing but interstellar emptiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see… I know it sounds insensitive to ask you that in such difficult times, but would you happen to have a document certifying you’re the lawful owner of the moon? Something like a purchase receipt or insurance bill. This would greatly speed up the investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I do not own the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh in that case, you are merely a witness rather than a plaintiff. Let me swiftly switch to form E-235. To write a more effective statement, could you describe some negative consequences of the crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Negative consequences? That’s obvious. For a start, I won’t be able to see birds at night and…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! It breaks my heart to hear that, night birds watching is such a pleasurable activity. But have you heard of electricity? I know many people claim it’s nothing but the ardent gaze of the Daemon. However, it works fairly well in practice, and no one came here to report any daemonic consequences so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can’t use a flashlight, it would scare birds. And it’s not only about me; what about tide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recent studies suggests that the moon accounts for a mere percent of it. I understand you’re shocked, but try to see the bright side of the situation. For instance, you don’t have to worry anymore about being attacked by a werewolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There’s no such thing as werewolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No recent studies I know allow you to back up that claim. At least now we are totally sure you won’t be savagely dismembered in a torrent of blood by a feral beast. I think that is something to rejoice about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you please stop babbling non sense and start acting like a real officer! I’m sure if someone was to announce you the sun has disappeared, you would stop playing with your tiny wooden sticks and move that big fat ass of yours, won’t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For sure dear Marc. We would all die within a few days without the sun, so I would go see Clara from the criminal division and ask her out. Heck, I would even kiss her right away in the office. You see, she’s hell of a woman and I’m too damn shy to even think about her, but in that scenario, it wouldn’t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, <em>dear Robert</em>. You’re a useless pile of donuts and Clara would be better off spending her last days with a giant talking broccoli. Now let me speak with your superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Mr Karlsson, our vice-captain in charge of celestial bodies, is back to his native Sweden for a few weeks of well deserved vacation. I will transmit him your request but let me be frank with you: I’ve seen an awful bunch of people like you during the years, who think their life is over because they lost their fancy phone or car. They left this office as if they were going to attend their own funerals but, after a few days, they realized such material possessions are no real concern and that the support of their friends and family is much more important. What I’m trying to say here is: don’t worry, be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marc stood up abruptly, his face livid from contained rage, and he slammed the door without a word. Five times. Once he reached the outside of the police station, he mechanically stared at the sky. To his surprise, the complete darkness that had devastated him had been replaced by a giant QR-code. Without much hope, he pulled his smartphone and scanned it. An ugly webpage straight from the 90s popped up on his screen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Earthlings — During a routine maintenance operation, a dysfunction in our stabilization engine accidentally blow up the moon. While our advanced security system prevented any further damage, we are deeply sorry for any inconvenience it might cause. However, despite this unfortunate event, we hope you will continue to trust us and we would like to remind you that we offer a wide range of planetary satellites coming in all shapes, colors and materials (including that cheese you seem so fond of). Good night.</em>&rdquo;</p>
