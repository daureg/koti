  title = {Modeling Urban Behavior by Mining Geotagged Social Data},
  author = {Emre {\c C}elikten and {Le Falher}, G{\'{e}}raud  and Mathioudakis, Michael},
  abstract = {Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich information on the
            whereabouts of urban dwellers. Specifically, such data reveal who spends time where,
            when, and on what type of activity (e.g., shopping at a mall, or dining at a
            restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe city regions in terms of
            activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens
            visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the
            evening.  Furthermore, once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate
            questions: What are the features that distinguish one region from another -- is it
            simply the type of venues they host or is it the visitors they attract?  What regions
            are similar across cities?

            In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions using publicly shared Foursquare
            data. In contrast with previous work, our method makes use of a probabilistic model with
            minimal assumptions about the data and thus relieves us from having to make arbitrary
            decisions in our analysis (e.g., regarding the granularity of discovered regions or the
            importance of different features). We perform an empirical comparison with previous work
            and discuss insights obtained through our findings.},

abstract        = {We address the problem of classifying the links of signed
social networks given their full structural topology. Motivated by a binary
user behaviour assumption, which is supported by decades of research in
psychology, we develop an efficient and surprisingly simple approach to solve
this classification problem. Our methods operate both within the active and
batch settings. We demonstrate that the algorithms we developed are extremely
fast in both theoretical and practical terms. Within the active setting, we
provide a new complexity measure and a rigorous analysis of our methods that
hold for arbitrary signed networks. We validate our theoretical claims carrying
out a set of experiments on three well known real-world datasets, showing that
our methods outperform the competitors while being much faster.},

  abstract = {Data generated on location-aware social media provide rich information about the
              places (shopping malls, restaurants, caf{\'{e}}s, etc) where citizens spend their
              time. That information can, in turn, be used to describe city neighborhoods in terms
              of the activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that
              citizens visit one neighborhood mainly for shopping, while another for its dining
              venues. In this paper, we present a methodology to analyze such data, describe
              neighborhoods in terms of the activity they host, and discover similar neighborhoods
              across cities. Using millions of Foursquare check-ins from cities in Europe and the
              US, we conduct an extensive study on features and measures that can be used to
              quantify similarity of city neighborhoods. We find that the earth-mover's distance
              outperforms other candidate measures in finding similar neighborhoods.  Subsequently,
              using the earth-mover's distance as our measure of choice, we address the issue of
              computational efficiency: given a neighborhood in one city, how to efficiently
              retrieve the {\$}k{\$} most similar neighborhoods in other cities. We propose a
              similarity-search strategy that yields significant speed improvement over the
              brute-force search, with minimal loss in accuracy. We conclude with a case study that
              compares neighborhoods of Paris to neighborhoods of other cities.},
