<p>She bowed to smell the flowers decorating a large tree. Despite the
arrogance of its taunting pink petals, its faint perfume failed to compete
against the other fragrances of the forest. From the heavy, dry scent of the
ground full of moss and fallen leaves to the reassuring smell of old oaks, the
air was saturated by the nature’s presence. The sun had just fallen and Valeria
decided she still had time to find a better floral present for her friend. More
selfishly, she was not in a hurry to get back home and told herself than a bit
of perfectionism had never killed anybody. However, such self justification
would have been more convincing if, immediately after raising her head, she had
not start running after a deer which just appeared in her field of view. Her
long legs and cheerful gait were giving her a fast pace, although it was no
match for the animal’s decades of practice and widely superior anatomy. She
stopped her pursuit with a radiant smile and, while she was catching her
breath, looked around her.</p> <p>The trees were younger and more separated
from each other. Furthermore, the tweeting of the birds sounded more distant,
giving the place an aura of peace and cozyness. She noticed a trail on the
ground, as if many animals had walked in the same direction. Following it and
pushing away some bushes, she arrived in front of a large body of water. Thanks
to the last rays of light, she could see ripples on its surface. She assumed
she had disturbed the residents of the forest which were drinking there prior
to her arrival. Not that she cared though, especially after remarking a human
shape along the shore, a few hundred meters away from her. It was too massive
to be one of the girl from the village. A crazy hope shook her: maybe a man
escaped and got lost in the forest. But in that case, how could he be standing
by the lake with no reaction from the water? She was too excited to think about
such questions right now. She rather felt like in one of those fairy tales
where an honest girl stumble upon a handsome aqua man, marry him and live
happily ever after.</p> <p>She ran toward him as fast as she could, waving her
hands and shouting joyful greetings at him. The man did not seem to pay
attention and when she reached him, she realized why. It was nothing more than
a wooden sculpture. Had she been less upset, she would have admired the craft
of the artist in the choice of material to make the scarce clothing, in the
fine details of the face and in the feeling of power and tenderness that
emanated from this masterpiece. Instead Valeria was furious to have been fooled
like this. She took consolation at the thought that at least there was no
witness in that remote place. Thus, when she heard the clapping of door and saw
a lady going toward her from a little cabin hidden in the trees, she did not
welcome her with her sweetest words: “What the hell is wrong with you, you
creepy moron? Do you find amusing to lure strangers to your big toy and hurt
their feelings while peeping in delight from your barn? Aren’t you too old for
such immature prank?”</p> <p>“I deeply apologize, please be sure there is no
malice in my work and that I didn’t mean to harm you in any way. I am
part-artist, part-sociologist and with this work, I want to illustrate and
understand the role that men play in our collective psyche. In fact if you have
time, I would be grateful if you could answer a questionnaire about your
feelings and expectations regarding love, procreation and related matters.”</p>
<p>“Ah! You’ve got a nerve. Let me tell you something, said Valeria, pointing
her finger to the head of the women. It will rain a lot tomorrow so I better go
to sleep and get ready for work. As for you, you should stop daydreaming about
men, get back to the village and start doing a useful job there as well.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned back from where she came.
Fortunately, she managed to find back and gather the pink camellia despite the
darkness. Going straight to her room, she was trembling with anger, first
directed toward that crazy sociologist, but even more toward herself: how could
she let her emotions drive her so foolishly?</p>
<hr />
<p>The smell of eggs frying in
a subtle blend of pepper and paprika woke her up. She opened her half empty
drawer and picked the trousers at the top of the pile, as they looked
convenient enough for a day of work. A few seconds of reflection convinced her
that a blue top with a large sparkling butterfly would highlight her slender
body while giving her sufficient freedom of movement. The most difficult part
was as always the choice of shoes. First because the second drawer was full of
them. Second because her decision should let her face any situation the day may
bring. They had to be solid, to stand for hours in a field; closed, to keep her
feet dry, but also comfortable, to walk in the streets at night time; relaxed
and graceful, to surprise her friends with an impromptu dance; sophisticated,
to impress them–but not too much, to assure the world she was a down-to-earth
person–, and even intriguing, fruity, and picturesque to make her feel good. In
other words, she had to pick the right shoes for the 9228th day of her life,
and she loved that.</p> <p>Upon leaving her room, she took a look in the mirror
hanging on the door. She was not a teenager anymore but her face was still
chubby, which sometimes made her look more glad than she was. This was
reinforced by her frequent smiles, which revealed two rows of pearly teeth
occupying her mouth with obvious joy and slight anarchy. In contrast, her eyes
appeared more classic and graced with a kind of aristocratic superiority, as if
they were well aware that their deep shade of dark blue was unmatched in a
dozen kilometers around. As her examination moved away from this pleasant face
of hers, she sighted softly at the view of her hair. Not that she would
complain about its light blond color, evocative of a morning summer sun over a
wild beach. But she had since long lost hope to comb them in any meaningful
way. She got used to its free spirit that could be curly one day and smooth the
next. Hopefully people will pay more attention to her shiny butterfly than her
messy mane she told herself while walking down the stairs to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Her mom had just finished cooking but was still humming a cheerful tune that
Valeria had heard a thousand time when she was a child. Both women smiled at
each other as they sat opposite sides of the table and started eating.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t hear you come in last night, said her mom, absorbed at
the sight of her plate and only glancing at her daughter once in a while. I was
going one more time through the exams of one of my students. I think I told you
already about Christina…”</p> <p>“Yes mom, I know everything there is to know
about the <em>amazing</em> Christina.”</p> <p>Valeria could not believe her
sarcasm went unnoticed yet her mom continued without hesitation:</p> <p>“She is
rather bright indeed, you should see how many philosophers she can cite in a
single paragraph! In addition, her family is willing to send her to university.
If we work hard enough this semester, I’m optimistic about her application. Of
course, if she gets accepted, she will need a tutor, so I may finally move to
the capital to help her.”</p> <p>“Finally”, echoed Valeria, nodding in support
and watching her mom’s eyes filled with stars.</p> <p>She deemed it too cruel
to remind her they were having this conversation every year. There was a
seemingly endless supply of brilliant students attending her mom’s school. Yet
all of them either get discouraged by the selectivity of the university
admission process or failed the entrance exam. Like her mom thirty years
ago.</p> <p>Looking around the kitchen, she could not see any empty bottle on
the floor. She deduced that this Christina was still making enough progress to
keep her teacher in that hopeful, sober phase. Which in turn meant Valeria
could enjoy a little longer the vision of her mom at the prime of her elegance.
Her body was thin and dry as she was getting close to her fiftieth birthday.
But it was more than counter balanced by her impeccable taste in clothing. Even
for breakfast she was wearing a strict red dress, slightly worn out but fitting
her divinely. Completing this outfit were measured and efficient gestures, a
composed tone of voice and a severe chignon of silver hair. Knowing from
experience the wreck she would turn to in a few months, Valeria got lost in the
contemplation of this beautiful lady. To such an extent that her mom felt
compelled to abandon her own daydreaming and asked her daughter how she
was.</p> <p>“I gathered flowers in Stern woods. They will make a nice gift for
Amelia. The dog she got as a child died last week. He was so cute, we all loved
him, but for her he was family, and his death has taken its toll. Two days ago
she forgot the keys of the storage room at work and I had to go to her place to
bring them back. Plus her mood is swinging all the time. One minute she wants
us all to sing campfire songs and the next, she cries as if there was no
tomorrow. Not only can’t she do any useful work but it’s starting to sap the
team moral. I know a mere bouquet won’t solve the problem, but if we show her
our support, I hope she will gradually get over it. Otherwise, we will have to
replace her, and this will involve time consuming interviews.”</p> <p><em>Not
  to mention I’m lonely enough that I can’t afford to lose a friend in that
  way</em>, thought Valeria while sipping the hot tea her mom brought while she
was talking. She wanted to tell her about the incident with the man sculpture
in the woods. It was pointless though, because she was not paying attention.
Valeria could see it from the way she was twisting her hands while gazing
through the window, dreaming about academic success. A more striking evidence
was the yellow shade of the aura surrounding her head. Valeria had noticed its
color since the beginning and it meant that nothing she could say would
interest her.</p>
<hr />
<p>For a long time, Valeria thought everyone could see those
auras, just like everyone could speak and hear. And with the years, she
understood how their colors were guiding her in interpreting people’s moods and
desires. However, it did not make her life easier. One day at the shop, she
warned her mom what a bad idea it was to buy a toy there, since the merchant
was lying to them. Asked to explain herself by an embarrassed mother, all she
could say was that the seller looked too green to be honest. No one was
convinced of course, and once they got home, Valeria realized she had been
given a unique gift. Being well versed in children stories, she knew that great
powers come with great responsibilities. Thus she conceived a plan as ambitious
and innocent as a child could do: she would become the ultimate peacekeeper,
solving conflicts thanks to her uncanny mind reading ability.</p> <p>Her own
mother being so dubious, she first exposed her project to her teacher at
school. This teacher was a compassionate lady, always patient with children and
quite used to their unpredictable ideas. But this one deserved a prize for its
originality and impracticalness, therefore it never came to her mind that it
could be true. Instead she spent a great deal of time trying to assess whether
Valeria was being molested by her family or by her schoolmates. Although it was
well intended, being dumbed down like that was also frustrating, and the
disappointed pupil decided to try a different approach. She would practice her
skill for a few years, and then make a spectacular demonstration in front of a
committee of experts.</p> <p>She grabbed a notebook and with unusual
resoluteness for such a young child, started recording colors and states of
mind from as many people as possible over several months. This involved asking
a lot of personal and precise questions, meaning that along precious data, she
gained the reputation of a tireless listener, full of empathy. She also noticed
that most of her fellow human beings were going through common emotional
turmoils. This helped her put her own problems into perspective and gave her an
emotional stability that later proved much useful in her line of work. The
villagers became aware of her precocious wisdom and would often visit her to
ask for advice, even on matters usually not devoted to teenager.</p> <p>Her
fame grew until it reached the ears of two high-ranked administrative officers
of the regional capital, who decided to pay her a visit out of curiosity.
Valeria seized that opportunity to exhibit her abilities and bring them to the
next level. She sat for three hour with the two women and painted them the most
terrifyingly detailed psychological portrait of themselves they could have ever
imagined. Asking them to focus on various emotion of their choice, the young
prodigy identified them with astonishing precision. At the end of the session,
measuring their satisfaction did not require any special trick as they were
giving triumphant smiles to each other. Already envisioning a future of
assisting her country by negotiating with terrorists or bringing back social
peace through informed dialog, Valeria was also delighted. At least until the
officials announced her they were from a secret intelligence unit and that she
could joined them after a few extra tests in a secure laboratory. She would
then have the privilege to serve the state by interrogating its worst enemies
kept in jail all over the territory.</p> <p>It was so far from her noble
aspirations that she urged them to leave immediately and forget her existence.
In her rage, she otherwise threaten in a high pitch tone to reveal all the
dirty secrets she just learned about them. They complied without resistance,
but from that day, she understood that what she once considered a gift was more
of a curse. Either people would not believe she could see auras, or they would
try to use her skill with no regard for her own motivations. Following this
realization, she stopped taking notes and asking questions. She also closed
herself to others and, although she was still polite and helpful, refused to
give advice anymore. Soon villagers forgot about her past behavior and
everything returned to normal, except for Valeria having lost her childhood
illusions.</p> <hr />
<p>The sound of fat raindrops crashing into the window
interrupted her recollection of bitter memories. It meant she was already late
to work. After kissing her unresponsive mom goodbye, she left home without her
jacket. The dark clouds were occluding the pale morning light and the horizon
was blurred by the rain falling in tight-knit squadron. No wind was dissipating
its smell, which was more rough and aggressive than the one of the first gentle
rain of spring. Yet Valeria was observing the deluge with an amused smile. She
took a deep breath, closed her eyes and let her mind wander, first right above
her head but soon rising to the sky like a daredevil bird. An outside observer
could not have seen anything but Valeria fancied imagining her spirit as a
trail of colored steam zigzagging through the air. Soon she got in touch with
the water. As usual, she started by a time of silent observation. The droplets
were falling with an excitement proportional to the number of boring days spent
packed in a cloud and moved aimlessly around the continent. Some of them were
racing to reach the ground while others took more freedom with gravity to
execute complex ballets before landing on their final destination.</p>
<p>Valeria was also the recipient of unspoken messages which she assumed were
intended to be humorous yet were too alien to make much sense to her. She often
wondered whether those kinds of communication were sent from individual units
of liquid, or if it was only an illusion maintained by the rain as a whole to
ease interactions. Up to this day, this was still a heavily debated point. On
one side stood unifiers, asserting that all the water in the world shared a
single consciousness. On the other side, individualists were telling stories of
tiny quantity of liquid forming special bonds and visiting them regularly over
years. Although the topic provided countless intellectually entertaining
discussions, in practice the point was moot. What really mattered was the
possibility to successfully influence the behavior of water at a mesoscopic
scale to serve human purposes.</p> <p>Which was what Valeria undertook. It was
not unlike convincing someone to do you a favour. She started by projecting
general feelings of happiness and calm to draw positive attention on herself.
Then she shared her joy at being covered in water: when taking a relaxing
shower after a tough day of work, running under the rain in a torrid summer
field, or swimming in a crystal-clear lake illuminated by the raising sun.
However, she nuanced her judgement by explaining how it was uncomfortable to
spend the day in wet clothes and that when the temperature was low like today,
it could even make her sick. A major difficulty was that concepts such as
sickness had no direct equivalent for the rain. One could try to find analogy,
like being polluted by a nefarious external entity. Yet it was more effective
to transcribe everything into basic emotions, for instance the frustration of
being bed-ridden. This was demanding at first, and required a leap of faith,
since it was not clear whether water could apprehend notions like frustration
or pain. But while no one could explain why, it was sensible to human emotions,
provided they were presented in a quiet, logical order, without sudden
variations. Indeed, she could feel the water agreeing with her and, once she
started walking, the droplets were avoiding here, although many were playfully
going as close as possible to her skin.</p>
