    post</a> (i.e. please go discuss there to the original author)</p>
    I shared these thoughts somewhere else on social media recently, but in a
    place where only a small handful of people saw it. The topic is always
    relevant, and given the positive response I got from a few people, I
    wanted to broadcast to a wider audience. Good luck to anyone who works
    their way through it, and know that if you disagree with any of the
    sentiments below, you and I might have some problems.</p>
  <h1>Women</h1><p>
    So, I’ve had a lot of thoughts about women lately, and wanted to share
    them in a place that people would see and be able to respond.<br>
    I should point out (though most of you know already) that I am a
    heterosexual white cisgender male. I am about as privileged as they come,
    and I’m doing my best to be aware of that, in particular here. For that
    reason, please PLEASE let me know if any or all of the following is
    offensive in any way. I consider myself a feminist, but I know there is
    always room to learn, which is part of why I plan on sharing these
    thoughts.<br>
    With that in mind, the following is a list of observations about women,
    (hopefully good) advice for other men, and praise of women overall (I’m
    hoping it’s mostly praise).</p>
  <h2> Women Are Fucking Beautiful </h2><p>
    Two immediate caveats I feel the need to add here are a) obviously, men
    are attractive, too; this is just a post from a heterosexual male. But
    more importantly, b) beauty does not contribute toward your character or
    your quality as a person (neither in a positive nor a negative way).<br>
    With all that in mind, WOMEN ARE FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. And I mean ALL women;
    fat, skinny, average, tall, short, blond, brunette, redhead, makeup,
    no-makeup. It doesn’t matter. Y’all are gorgeous. And every part of you as
    well: your hair, your eyes, your lips, your dimples, your cheeks, your
    smiles, your arms, your shoulders, your breasts, your bellies, your hips,
    your butts, your legs. And not just your bodies either: your voices, your
    grace, your clothes, your courage, your strength, your walk. It’s all just
    beautiful.*<br>
    It’s both very sad and a shame that (mostly men) have made you believe
    otherwise. I have friends in committed relationships who have been led to
    believe that the slightest changes in their bodies will make their S.O.
    think they’re no longer beautiful. And that is so sad and so wrong. You
    are beautiful in general, and beautiful in everything you do. And I hope
    you tell yourselves that.</p>
    <p>*That said, I know that you often end up being victims of the male
    gaze. I know I’ve been a culprit of this in the past. For me and anyone
    else, I am sorry. I am trying to recognize and correct these bad habits,
    not only in myself, but in anyone else who might listen to me.</p>
    <h2> Women Can Be Whoever They Want And Do Whatever They Want, And Should
      Be Treated And Paid Equally To Men When They Do It </h2><p>
    I saw a post floating around from someone recently talking about how Rey
    from TFA is not a good role model for girls, because she does things
    typically associated with badass men. I’d like to think I understand what
    they’re trying to say (I’d love to hear the opinions of some more women on
    that article), but I completely disagree, because the message I got from
    that opinion was “Women who want to do what men typically do aren’t good
    examples for women.” And again, that seems completely counterproductive to
    feminism, because if a girl wants to do “traditionally masculine” things,
    she should be allowed to, and should not be criticized for it. Similarly,
    if she wants to be more “traditionally feminine,” she should not be
    criticized by her fellow women and especially not by men for doing so. Any
    girl should be who she wants to be and do what she wants to do.<br>
    This whole point as well as the next one should be an obvious, inherent
    fact. However, very sadly, this is not the case. I will fight for you
    whenever I can for both that and the following point.</p>
    <h2> Consent Is Not Only Absolutely Necessary, But The Sexiest Thing Imaginable </h2><p>
    Consent is a must. 100% of the time. No questions about it. Sober, aware
    consent IS A MUST. Honestly, I don’t understand how there are still men
    that don’t understand this.<br>
    It’s also, in all honestly, the sexiest thing possible. There is nothing
    more warming than becoming intimate with someone who also wants to be
    intimate with you in that moment.<br>
    Like, as established earlier, you’re beautiful, and if you’re consenting,
    you’re turning me on. But also the fact that you’re consenting turns me
    on. And also the fact that if you’re consenting I’m (hopefully) turning
    you on, turns me on. And also, if you’re turned on by you turning me on,
    that turns me on, too. (I know that got confusing, but they’re all
    different things).<br>
    The point is, without consent, a man being turned on by a woman is usually
    creepy at best. With consent, there is so much more to get turned on by,
    and I truly mean that.</p>
    <h2> As A Whole, You Deserve To Be Treated So Much Better Than You Are (By Men) </h2><p>
    This is unfortunately true in all walks of life, but in particular with
    dating and romance, which is what I’m talking about here. You deserve to
    be courted. You deserve to be respected. You deserve to be complimented.
    You deserve thoughtful dates and gifts, and expressions of love. And most
    importantly, you deserve not to be treated like a piece of meat, or like
    an inferior being.<br>
    You also deserve to be sexually empowered. You deserve to be promiscuous
    or conservative (whatever is your preference) without judgment. You
    deserve consent. You deserve all this and so much more that I have trouble
    putting into words.<br>
    I see so many of my female friends time and time again complain to me
    about their romantic woes, where the guy they thought was so nice turned
    out to be an asshole. For so long, I would always think to myself “why do
    you keep going after these guys?” Until I realized: the men are the
    problem, because they deceive these women into thinking they’re something
    they’re not. They wait until they’ve gotten whatever it is they wanted,
    and then they show their true colors. It’s a sad, sad cycle that I wish
    men would break, because what will eventually happen (if it hasn’t
    already) is that women will stop believing there are any good guys out
    there (I’d like to believe there still are good guys - I hope I am one of
    them - even if they are few and far between).</p>
    <h2> You Deserve To Talk About Your Vaginas </h2><p>
    I’ve had three different women in the past month apologize to me for
    making a comment about their periods. Every time, my reaction was
    basically, “Do not apologize for talking about your health. I am your
    friend, and I care about you, and I want to hear how you’re doing.” I feel
    terrible for the fact that you have been made to feel like your vaginas
    and specifically your periods are this disgusting, taboo subject unfit for
    normal conversation. It’s ridiculous, and I wish society didn’t make you
    feel this way. I hope you can at least get your friends to understand that
    so that you don’t have to apologize to them, and hopefully someday you
    won’t have to apologize to anyone.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
    I hope this spewing of thoughts has been clear and inoffensive, but I’m
    really hoping that if any of it is offensive, I get called out for it. I
    wanted this to be a learning experience both for me and other
    less-informed men who might read this. The closest thing I have to an
    actual conclusion is the following.<br>
    Women are beautiful, profound creatures who deserve so much better than
    what society currently offers. I hope my female friends continue to feel
    more empowered, independent, and beautiful. I hope I am lucky enough to
    some day share this positivity and more with a female partner. And of
    course, if there is anything written above that would prevent that from
    happening, please please PLEASE let me know. And if you made it all the
    way here to the end; thank you, let me know, and I will gladly give you
    more compliments (and not about your appearance).</p>
